Fitzpatrick-Turelli phylogenetic control (node-weighted averages) for interspecific crosses

December 24th - This version assumes that the crossing matrix is symmetric and requires branch lengths.
It was used in Turelli, Lipkowitz, and Brandvain. Evolution 2014, which used mean success of a reciprocal cross for the crossing matrix. 
 An updated and flexible version that does not require branch lengths and handle assymetric cross success will be added shortly.
